# All4Fit
The application is for a healthy lifestyle and has features for managing diet and exercise, as well as a BMI calculator.

It was created based on UML diagrams as a part of a Software Engineering course assignment.

The application was written in C# and uses the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) platform. WPF was used to create an intuitive and responsive user interface that enables easy management of diet and exercise, as well as using the BMI calculator.

Code uses text files as a local data source. The application probably stores information about diet, exercise, BMI calculations and users informations in text files instead of a database.
